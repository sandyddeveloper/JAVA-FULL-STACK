ðŸ”¥ Complex Questions

1. Find the total revenue (quantity Ã— price) grouped by each product_name, only for those orders that were delivered and paid.

> Hint: Use WHERE clause with payment_status and delivery_date IS NOT NULL.




2. Find customers who placed multiple orders for the same product with a total quantity > 100.

> Hint: Use GROUP BY with HAVING clause.




3. Display all orders where the delivery took more than 7 days from the order_date.

> Hint: Use DATEDIFF() or delivery_date - order_date depending on your DBMS.




4. Show the list of customers who have not made any payment or whose payment failed and the order was placed more than 30 days ago.

> Hint: Use logical operators with payment_status and date comparison.




5. Display the customer name, product name, and a discounted price assuming a 10% discount on orders with quantity >= 50.

> Hint: Use CASE in SELECT clause.




6. Find the number of orders per month where the order amount is above the average order amount of all orders.

> Hint: Use AVG() in a subquery and MONTH(order_date).




7. Write a query to find all orders where the product_name contains at least two vowels next to each other.

> Hint: Use LIKE '%aa%' OR LIKE '%ee%' ... or REGEXP if supported.




8. Find customers whose first and last order had more than 60 days gap.

> Hint: Use MIN(order_date) and MAX(order_date) with GROUP BY.




9. Display all customers who placed an order on a weekend and the order was successfully delivered.

> Hint: Use date functions like DAYOFWEEK() or TO_CHAR() to find weekends.




10. Show a list of unique products where the average delivery time is less than 3 days and more than 5 orders have been placed.



> Hint: Use GROUP BY product_name, HAVING, and average date differences.
