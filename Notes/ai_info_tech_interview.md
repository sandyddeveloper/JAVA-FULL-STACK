🎯 Focus Area: Core Java for Automation Testing

🧠 1. Java Basics (Syntax & Structure)

Know these clearly:

main() method structure

Data types & variables

Operators (arithmetic, logical, relational, ternary)

Conditional statements (if, switch)

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Difference between break & continue


🧩 Example Qs:

What is the difference between == and .equals()?

What’s the difference between local, instance, and static variables?

What’s the difference between while and do-while loop?



---

⚙️ 2. OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming)

Very important for automation.

Be ready to explain and code small examples of:

Class and Object

Constructor (default, parameterized)

this and super keywords

Inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical)

Polymorphism (method overloading and method overriding)

Encapsulation (private variables + public getters/setters)

Abstraction (abstract class & interface)


🧩 Example Qs:

What’s the difference between abstract class and interface?

What’s the use of this() and super()?

Can constructor be overridden?

What’s method overloading vs overriding?



---

💡 3. String Handling

They’ll test this because automation heavily uses Strings (locators, text comparison, etc.)

Know:

String methods (length(), charAt(), equals(), contains(), substring(), split(), replace())

StringBuilder vs StringBuffer

Immutable concept


🧩 Example Qs:

Why String is immutable in Java?

How to reverse a string without using inbuilt methods?



---

🧾 4. Collections Framework

Used in automation for handling test data, elements, etc.

Focus on:

List, Set, Map

ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap

Difference between List and Set

Iterating using for-each or Iterator


🧩 Example Qs:

Difference between Array and ArrayList?

How to iterate through a Map?

Can List contain duplicate elements?



---

⚙️ 5. Exception Handling

Common in automation when scripts fail.

Understand:

try, catch, finally, throw, throws

Checked vs Unchecked exceptions


🧩 Example Qs:

Can we use multiple catch blocks?

What’s the difference between throw and throws?



---

🧠 6. File Handling (Optional but Useful)

Used in automation for reading test data or writing results.

File, FileReader, BufferedReader

FileWriter, BufferedWriter



---

🧩 7. Practice Small Logic Programs

They may give coding tasks like:

Reverse a string / number

Check palindrome

Find duplicate characters in string

Sort an array

Count vowels/consonants

Find missing number in array



---

💬 8. HR / Practical Questions

They might ask:

“Why do you want to work in automation testing?”

“Difference between manual and automation testing?”

“Which tools have you heard of?”

“What’s your approach if a test case fails?”
