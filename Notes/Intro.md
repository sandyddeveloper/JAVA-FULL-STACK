# JAVA 

java is an Advanced oops language 

class FirstProgram
main() {
    system.printlm("hello World")
}

for this simple program i we to use class name for that.. this is why we say this as a advanced oops 

java doesnt have pointer like more complex thing.. everything will deals with objects in java

in java it is Architectural neutral which means in c language we store int some value, in some machine it stores like 2 bytes or 4 bytes .. but in java  only take 4 bytes cinstandly

How java works
